# ipinfo-lite
ipinfo-lite is a tiny IP information site written in PHP as my first PHP project.

Visiting an ipinfo-lite instance provides you with your IP address, its DNS hostname and the user agent string.
It's also compatible with console tools, supporting cURL and GNU Wget.
The goal of this tool is to be fast and dead-simple. Design is adapted from the
[better moterfucking website](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/).

It is free software, available under ISC License.

# Usage
Extract all but this readme file into a directory on your webserver. The webapp is then available from it's directory name.
